# Brian's FreeBSD Profile

A repository for scripts and configurations that make me hate FreeBSD a little less.

## What it Does

* Configures Git settings
* Installs ZSH
* Installs Oh My ZSH!
* Installs Neovim

## Usage

To run the script to install and configure all the things, run:

```sh
./setup-profile.sh
```

This is an interactive script that makes changes to the current user's profile and
elevates using `sudo` when it needs permissions to install stuff.
